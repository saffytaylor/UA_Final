    "\n",
    "In order to carry out geodemographic clustering, we must further process the data we made using spatial microsimulation. The data we produced in the previous methodology is granular data, representing individuals in York. However, in order to carry out a k-means clustering (as we do here), the data needs to be in aggregate format. We do this in our <a href=\"cleaning.ipynb#Cleaning-for-Geodemographics\">cleaning section</a>, by subsetting the BSA dataframe by categories (age, sex, whether they voted in the last election or not etcetera) and using the pandas 'pivot' function to change the index to 'geo_codes', effectively aggregating the table, and then grouping the data by value and electoral zone, and adding these into a new dataframe. \n",

    "| Age | Demographic | Including a categorical measure of age to see if there are differences in individuals over the age of 65 versus the rest of the population. Age is also a core demographic characteristic, and is often considered necessary to include in all studies of demography. |\n",
    "| Sex | Demographic | Same as age, sex is often regarded as a core demographic characteristic to be included in all demographic studies. |\n",
